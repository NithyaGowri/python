# Numberic Data Type

**1. Numeric Data Types in Python (int, float):**

- Python supports two primary numeric data types: `int` for integers and `float` for floating-point numbers.
- Integers are whole numbers, and floats can represent both whole and fractional numbers.
- You can perform arithmetic operations on these types, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.
- Be aware of potential issues with floating-point precision, which can lead to small inaccuracies in calculations.
- Python also provides built-in functions for mathematical operations, such as `abs()`, `round()`, and `math` module for advanced functions.

Operator	Name	Example
+	Addition	x + y
-	Subtraction	x - y
*	Multiplication	x * y
/	Division	x / y
%	Modulus	x % y
**	Exponentiation	x ** y
//	Floor division	x // y
